//! Shared combat statistics for both Cat and Enemy entities.
//!
//! Both factions describe their units with the same set of mechanical
//! properties, laid out differently in their respective source files. This
//! module holds the unified [`Entity`] both are parsed into, along with the
//! registry that recognizes which abilities a given entity carries.
//!
//! Each layout publishes its own column mapping as a slice of [`Column`], so a
//! consumer needing to know which raw index feeds which field can read the
//! parser's own table rather than restating it.
